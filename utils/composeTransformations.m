function [Tout] = composeTransformations(T1,T2,varargin)
%composeTransformations Combines polynomial transformations into one: x = Tᵒᵘᵗ(z) = T₁(T₂(...Tₙ(z)))
%
%   Usage: [Tout] = composeTransformations(T1,T2)
%
%   Inputs:
%       T1,T2,... - cell arrays containing the polynomial transformation
%                   coefficients. At least two transformations are required,
%                   but more can be included and the function will apply
%                   the transformations one at a time recursively.
%
%   Output:
%       Tout - cell array containing the polynomial coefficients for the
%              composed transformation.
%
%   Note: Generally, combining transformations increases the polynomial degree
%   of the resulting transformation, so this is not always the most efficient
%   way to do things. For example, if you combine two degree 3 transformations,
%   you get a degree 9 transformation. It would likely be more efficient to just
%   evaluate them one after the other. Additionally, in this function, we
%   truncate the result to the degree of the first transformation, so there will
%   be a truncation error.
%
%   Description: (Lemma 1, [1]) Consider the function p(Φ(z)), where
%           p(x) = P₁x + P₂(x⊗x) + ... + Pd(x...⊗x)                      (1)
%           Φ(z) = T₁z + T₂(z⊗z) + ... + Tₖ(z...⊗z)                      (2)
%   In the new z coordinates, f(z) = p(Φ(z)) can be written to degree d as
%           f(z) = F₁z + F₂(z⊗z) + ... + Fd(z...⊗z)
%   where
%            i
%       Fᵢ = ∑ Pⱼ 𝓣ⱼ,ᵢ                                                    (3)
%           j=1
%   and 𝓣ⱼ,ᵢ is calligraphic T, used to compactly write the sum of all unique
%   tensor products with j factors and nⁱ columns [2]. This is easily
%   verifiable: inserting the expansions (1) and (2) gives
%           p(Φ(z)) = P₁(Φ(z)) + P₂(Φ(z)⊗Φ(z)) + ...
%                   = P₁(T₁z + T₂(z⊗z) + ...)
%                     + P₂( (T₁z + T₂(z⊗z) + ...) ⊗ (T₁z + T₂(z⊗z) + ...) )
%                     + ...
%   This is exactly what is implemented in this function, where p(x) = T₁(x) and
%   Φ(z) = T₂(z) in the derivation above. See also transformDynamics() for
%   possible improvements. The quantities Pⱼ 𝓣ⱼ,ᵢ can be computed using the
%   function calTTv() from the KroneckerTools repository; it is possible that
%   improvements can be made to avoid having to transpose things. This function
%   could also be adapted to take an optional polynomial degree argument.
