function z = newtonIteration(x, g, J, maxIter, verbose)
%newtonIteration Solve g(z) = x for z using Newton iteration
%
%   Usage:  z = newtonIteration(x, g, J)
%
%   Inputs:     x - point at which to evaluate the transformation
%               g - function handle for the function g(z)
%               J - function handle for the Jacobian J(z) = ‚àÇg(z)/‚àÇz
%         maxIter - maximum number of iterations
%         verbose - boolean, whether to print runtime info
%
%   Outputs:    z - the value of z = g‚Åª¬π(x)
%
%   Description: Assume we have a function x = g(z); given z, we can
%   obtain x by evaluating the function forwards. However, what if we are
%   given x and wish to find the z such that g(z) = x? This is the inverse
%   problem of finding the function z = g‚Åª¬π(x); in general, this is
%   nontrivial for nonlinear functions g(z).
%
%   One method for solving this problem is the famous Newton iteration
%   [1]. It is straightforward to derive Newton's method, but for space I
%   will omit the derivation and simply give the formula. Define the
%   function ∆í(z) = g(z) - x, where x is fixed so not a variable; the goal
%   is to find roots of the equation ∆í(z) = 0. Then, given an initial guess
%   z_0, we can iteratively improve our approximation as
%
%       z‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ  =  z‚Çô - ∆í(z‚Çô) / ∆í'(z‚Çô)
%
%   where ∆í'(z‚Çô) is the derivative of the function (assuming we can
%   evaluate it as well). The extension to multivariate polynomials is
%   straightforward: now z and ∆í(z) are vectors, so ∆í'(z) is the Jacobian
%   matrix (matrix of partial derivatives ‚àÇg·µ¢(z)/‚àÇz‚±º), which since the
%   vector x is fixed is the same as the Jacobian of ∆í(z). Defining the
%   Jacobian as J(z) = ‚àÇ∆í(z)/‚àÇz, the Newton iteration formula then becomes
%
%       z‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ  =  z‚Çô - J(z‚Çô)‚Åª¬π ∆í(z‚Çô)
%
%   which is the solution of a linear system of equations at each step.
%   This is done in line 79. Note that in the code, we do not store z‚Çô,
%   we overwrite it at each step.
%
%   Specific usage: For usage with input-normal/output-diagonal
%   transformation x = Œ¶(z), the function handles would be
%       g = @(z) kronPolyEval(TinOd, z)
%       J = @(z) jcbn(TinOd, z)
%   This can all be done in one line if desired:
%       z0 = newtonIteration(x0, @(z) kronPolyEval(TinOd, z), @(z) jcbn(TinOd, z));
%
%   For usage with balancing transformation x = ÃÖŒ¶(zÃÑ), we need to
%   compose the transformations as x = Œ¶(ùùã(zÃÑ))
%       g = @(z) PhiBar(z,TinOd,sigmaSquared)
%       J = @(z) PhiBarJacobian(z,TinOd,sigmaSquared)
%   This can all be done in one line if desired:
%       z0 = newtonIteration(x0, @(z) PhiBar(z,TinOd,sigmaSquared), @(z) PhiBarJacobian(z,TinOd,sigmaSquared));
